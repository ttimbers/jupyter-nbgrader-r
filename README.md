# Demonstration of Jupyter and nbgrader for autograding R assignments

Author: Tiffany Timbers

This repository is a demonstration of how to use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/index.html) and [nbgrader](https://nbgrader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for autograding R assignments.

Talk slides: [ttimbers.github.io/jupyter-nbgrader-r](https://ttimbers.github.io/jupyter-nbgrader-r/)

There are two different ways you can interact with this demo:

2. [See an instructor-like experience via a local install of all the required software](#installation-instructions-for-all-software-required-for-the-demo)

## Installation instructions for all software required for the demo

We provide install instructions for the 3 major operating systems:

1. [Mac OSX](#mac-osx)
2. [Windows](#windows)
3. [Ubuntu](#ubuntu)

### Mac OSX

#### Python

nbgrader is a Python program, thus you will need to install it even if you plan to run R in Jupyter. Luckily, [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos), a popular Python distribution comes with Jupyter as well! When you install Anaconda, you need __Python 3__ to run nbgrader, not __Python 2__, so please choose the Anaconda version that includes Python 3.9 (or higher)

Head to [https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos) and download the Anaconda version for Mac OS with **Python 3.9** (or higher). Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer.

#### R and the IRkernel and RStudio
To use R with Jupyter, you will need to install R and the IRkernel. To install R, go to [https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/) and download the latest version of R for Mac. Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

To install the IR kernel open R and type the following commands into the console:

```
install.packages(c('IRkernel'))
```

Next, open **terminal** and type the following:

```
R -e "IRkernel::installspec()"
```

#### nbgrader

Open the terminal and type the following: 

```
conda install -c conda-forge nbgrader
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --py nbgrader --overwrite
jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py nbgrader
jupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix --py nbgrader
```

### Windows

#### Python

nbgrader is a Python program, thus you will need to install it even if you plan to run R in Jupyter. Luckily, [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos), a popular Python distribution comes with Jupyter as well! When you install Anaconda, you need __Python 3__ to run nbgrader, not __Python 2__, so please choose the Anaconda version that includes Python 3.7

Head to <https://www.anaconda.com/download/#windows> and download the Anaconda version for Windows with **Python 3.7**. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer.

#### R and the IRkernel and RStudio
To use R with Jupyter, you will need to install R and the IRkernel. To install R, go to <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/> and download the latest version of R for Windows. Open the file and follow the installer instructions. Open the file and follow the installer instructions.

To install the IR kernel open R and type the following commands into the console:

```
install.packages(c('IRkernel'))
IRkernel::installspec()
```

#### nbgrader

Open CMD and type the following: 

```
conda install -c conda-forge nbgrader
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --py nbgrader --overwrite
jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py nbgrader
jupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix --py nbgrader
```

### Ubuntu

#### Python

nbgrader is a Python program, thus you will need to install it even if you plan to run R in Jupyter. Luckily, [__Anaconda__](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos), a popular Python distribution comes with Jupyter as well! When you install Anaconda, you need __Python 3__ to run nbgrader, not __Python 2__, so please choose the Anaconda version that includes Python 3.7

Head to https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux and download the Anaconda version for Linux with **Python 3.7** (make sure the linux tab is selected). Once the download is finished, open Terminal and execute the following commands:
```
bash path/to/the/file
```

For example,
```
bash Downloads/Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
The instructions for the installation will then appear: (1) press Enter; (2) once the licence agreement shows, you can keep pressing enter to go through the whole document, or press Q to quit; (3) Type `yes` to accept the licence agreement; (4) you can accept the default installation location (just press Enter once again); (5) Type `yes` once again to accept the installer to run `conda init`.

#### R and the IRkernel and RStudio

To use R with Jupyter, you will need to install R and the IRkernel. To install R, follow the instructions below:

Type the following in the Terminal to add the key ID for the CRAN network:

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
```

Type `sudo apt-add-repository` in Terminal followed by the corresponding line for your version:
  - for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal) add: `'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/'`
  - for Ubuntu 19.04 (Disco) add: `'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu disco-cran35/'`
  - for Ubuntu 18.04.1 (Bionic Beaver) add: `'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/'`
  - for Ubuntu 17.10.1 (Artful Aardvark) add: `'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/'`
  - for Ubuntu 16.04.4 (Xenial Xerus) add: `'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu xenial-cran35/'`
  - for Ubuntu 14.04.5 (Trusty Tahr) add: `'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty-cran35/'`

For example, for Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal):
```
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu focal-cran40/'`
```

Then, update the repository:
```
sudo apt-get update
 ```

Next, install the following packages:
```
sudo apt-get install curl libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libpq-dev libxml2-dev r-base
 ```
 
To install the IR kernel open R and type the following commands into the console:

```
install.packages(c('IRkernel'))
IRkernel::installspec()
```

#### nbgrader

Open the terminal and type the following: 

```
conda install -c conda-forge nbgrader
jupyter nbextension install --sys-prefix --py nbgrader --overwrite
jupyter nbextension enable --sys-prefix --py nbgrader
jupyter serverextension enable --sys-prefix --py nbgrader
```
